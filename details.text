we are going to use laravel fortify

--> composer require laravel/fortify

and then we need to publish it

--> php artisan vendor:publish --provider="laravel\\Fortify\\FortifyServiceProvider"

after that we migrate to database

after that we need to install bootstrap

-->npm i bootstrap@ popper.js sass sass-loader --save-dev

after the import of bootstrap we run

--> npm run dev

to make any changes in bootstrap or css run

--> npm run watch
